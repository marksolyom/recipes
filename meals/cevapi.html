    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cevapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of kebab, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe. They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Serbia. They are also common in Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, as well as in Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and the Italian provinces bordering Slovenia. They are usually served of 5–10 pieces on a plate or in a flatbread, often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, cottage cheese, minced red pepper, and salt. Bosnian cevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed cevapi are grilled. Serb cevapiare made of either beef, lamb or pork or mixed. Macedonian, Croatian, Bulgarian and Romanian varieties are often made of both pork and beef.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, ground beef, ground lamb and egg white. Firstly, mix the meat with white egg. Than add all the rest of the ingredients: the garlic, salt, baking soda, black pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. Mix well using your hands.</li>
            <li>Form into finger length, “fat” sausages about 2.5 cm thick. Arrange them on a plate.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap or foil paper and refrigerate for one-hour minimum or even better for 24 hours. This is important to let the flavors settle and the mixture become firm.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grilling surface. Preheat the grill, medium-low heat and than add Cevapi!</li>
            <li>Grill Cevapcici until they are cooked through, turning as needed. The grilling of Cevapi usually takes about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve in warmed or grilled (this is a better solution) flat bread with chopped onions.</li>
        </ol>
